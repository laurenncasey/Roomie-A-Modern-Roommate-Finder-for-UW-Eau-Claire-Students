# Roomie: A Modern Roommate Finder for UW–Eau Claire Students

This project was developed as part of a **Mobile Development** course at the University of Wisconsin–Eau Claire.  
> **Note:** This project is unfinished and not currently in production.

## Overview

**Roomie** is a fast and modern mobile application built with Android Studio using the Kotlin programming language. Designed to help UW–Eau Claire students find compatible roommates, Roomie features an intuitive user interface, in-app data storage, and a smart matching algorithm based on roommate preferences.

## Key Features

- **Matching Algorithm**  
  Suggests potential roommates with at least a 62.5% preference match.

- **Roommate Preferences**  
  Allows users to set detailed roommate criteria, which the app uses for tailored matches.

- **In-App Messaging**  
  Enables users to chat directly once both accept the match.

- **Swipe-to-Match**  
  Users can swipe to accept or decline roommate candidates.

- **Data Privacy**  
  All user information is stored securely within the app. No external data is shared.

## How It Works

1. Users create a profile and set their roommate preferences.
2. The app stores data in its internal database.
3. Roomie’s algorithm suggests potential roommates with a match rate of 62.5% or higher.
4. Users swipe through matches, accepting or declining them.
5. If both users accept, in-app messaging is enabled.
