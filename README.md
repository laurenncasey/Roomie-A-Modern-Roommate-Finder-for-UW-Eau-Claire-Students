# Roomie: A Modern Roommate Finder for UW-Eau Claire Students

This project was completed in a Mobile Development class as part of UWEC curriculum. It is unfinished and not in production. 


Roomie is a fast and modern mobile application built in Android Studio using the Kotlin programming language. Designed to help UW-Eau Claire students find roommates easily, Roomie offers an intuitive interface, an in-app database, and a smart matching algorithm to connect users based on their roommate preferences.

Key Features:
Matching Algorithm: Roomie’s algorithm matches users with potential roommates who align with their preferences by at least 62.5%.
Roommate Preferences: Users can set detailed roommate preferences, which the app uses to generate tailored matches.
In-App Messaging: When two users mutually accept each other as roommates, they can communicate directly through the app.
Swipe-to-Match: Users can browse through roommate candidates and choose to accept or decline their matches.
Data Privacy: All user information remains securely within the app; no external data usage or sharing.
How It Works:
Users create a profile, set their roommate preferences, and are stored in the app’s internal database.
Roomie’s matching algorithm suggests potential roommates with a 62.5% or higher match rate.
Users swipe through potential roommates and can accept or decline matches.
If two users accept each other, in-app messaging is enabled, allowing them to connect and chat.
